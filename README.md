# Handwritten Digit Recognition
 ## A project using TensorFlow for recognize digits

In this project I used the mnist handwritten digits to train the AI,
its a sequential model composed of 784 neurons in input layer (Since images in the database is 28x28), 2 hidden layers using ReLu as a actvation method, one with 250 neurons and the other one with 100 neurons
and 10 output neurons using SoftMax as a actvation method.

Its has made to recognize digits written in almost real time since the resolution is 28x28, here is a [video](https://youtu.be/pKWzuIzTNCA) showing how it works.

I made it just for study, gonna improve it in the future.
